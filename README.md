Documentation
-------------

High-level specifications for the DK2 headset, sensor, and firmware.

Cable
-----

The cable is surprisingly one of the most complex parts of the product, and
is likely actually more advanced than the entirety of DK1.  This directory
contains schematics and high level specifications for the cable, but this
is a custom assembly that likely isn't achievable to recreate from source.

Sensor
------

The positional tracking sensor release contains electrical and mechanical
CAD.  The sensor also utilizes microcontrollers which require firmware
which was not redistributable.

Headset
-------

The headset directory contains the mainboard firmware as well as electrical
and mechanical CAD for the headset.  It also contains artwork for the
packaging.
